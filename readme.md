# Smooth scroll in pure CSS

adapted from [this JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/e9d1jr2t/),

Issues:

1. the original (ab)used duplicate IDs for the sibling selectors (author unknown). Will try to fix this.
2. If you don't want the scrollbar, but can live with not reponding to mouse scrolling (usability issue?) just add (or uncomment in the code) `overflow: hidden;` for the `body` selector.
