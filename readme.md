# Smooth scroll in pure CSS

adapted from the [MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-behavior) by [Florian Scholz](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/profiles/fscholz).

**Tested** on Chrome v62, Firefox v57 (no support yet in Safari, Edge).

**Note:** the [W3C CSS validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) does not yet recognise `scroll-behavior: smooth`.
